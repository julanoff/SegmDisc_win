OBJECTIVES:

Create an infrastructure for ALL health care participants that enables secure, robust, reliable health related 
information exchange.
It should be independent from the internal record format of the participants.
It should use common , standard communication protocols that will accommodate ALL necessary exchanges.
It should allow secure and reliable access to the clients' information which resides in the HRB (health rec bank).

Company Profile:
Julan Management & Consulting have been in the banking funds transfer business for over 25 years. 
Our vast experience includes protocol design and development, implementation large of MTS. ACH systems for the 
large financial institutions like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of NY.
We have a clear vision how to solve communication tasks, organize secure environment, network establishment etc.
Managing the software development process from the initial design stage all the way to successful implementation is our
strength. 
This knowledge and experience could provide new angle to this important task.





How and why this approach will prevail:

Market Forces will govern the evolution of the whole process in future.
The first step is to build rudimentary infrastructure similar to the banks money transfer 
networks (Bankwire, Swift, Telex, etc).
People have not been forced to keep their money in the banks. The convenience and attractive benefits are 
luring people to the banks.
After they deposit their money in the bank the people demand certain services with it.
In HR record keeping. 
There will be numerous HRBs (Health Record Banks) where people will keep their records.
What will force them to do it?
Ability to earn something by allowing anonymous access for researches, statistics, pharmaceutical scientists.
Convenience to access and manage own records in real time.
Incentives to share the information to gain advance warning on certain abnormalities in the vitals.

The competition between the HRBs will drive the innovation of the benefits, creating new apps, etc.
It will lead to demand to HRP (health care provider) to participate in this activities.
Before a person goes to a doc or lab he or she will demand participation in HR Exchange.
There will be competition among HRBs and HRPs for a patient which will enhance this process.
It will evolve with time. New services, benefits, applications will be created.
IT people will compete in the new tremendous market of doctors, patients, hospitals, labs, etc.
It is similar to large companies like FundTEch, ACI who create MTS application for large players.
Variety of mobile apps creators to enable people's access to own information.


Similarity with banking network evolvement.

At the beginning of banking there were a lot of branches across the country ( Individual Medical Accounts with 
different holders) that had troubles to communicate in order to conduct banking business as we know it today.
The government realized the problem and created the Federal Reserve network. 
After that the banking became dynamic, accessible and more useful.
Since than other private and semi private networks sprang up like CHIPS and SWIFT - the survivors,
BankWire and other - extinct ones.
They allowed US dollar clearing and highly sensitive financial message exchanges around the globe. 
Any institution could become a member as long as it complies with rules and follow the communication protocol.
The medical record exchange will need similar approach. 

It took a while until people embraced online banking. During this process people started to get comfortable with
doing financial transaction over the net. That led to make people in charge of the management of their finances, 
giving instructions to the banks who to pay and how. This part varies from bank to bank.


The EHRS should be approached as such.
Each individual needs an account with EHRS holding company (similar to banks).
A person should be able to give instructions to the record holding company how to move his own records from one participating institution to another.
A record holding companies could charge fees for certain services. The market will regulate those fees
and services. (again similar to the banks)

Doctors, hospitals, laboratories should be mandated to transfer patient's data over to the specified institution
upon patient's request.
When  admitted to the hospital, a person gives authorization to the hospital or doctor to access the records.
Some work is being done to establish Medical Accounts for Individuals. The means of communications between
Individual Medical Account and Providers, Doctors, Laboratories needs to be addressed.
There is a need for secure communication among myriad of Providers, Doctors, Individuals, Laboratories etc. ,
maintaining unique Ids and addresses of each participant, 
guaranteeing secured delivery of each transaction and many more other aspects of modern exchanges.
It is a process that will be evolving through times. 



Future possible services and advances:
Virtual doctors where several specialists will monitor your health remotely
This way if a person develops certain disease he or she can join the specialize network of physicians who will
monitor their conditions virtually, order tests, prescribe medicine, etc. If needed, the person is directed to visit a doc.
That alone will drive health care cost down tremendously.

Participants:
HRBs ( similar to the banks)
Hospitals, large Labs ( similar to the corporate/financial institutions)
3rd party access providers - IT organizations that provide access to small Labs, doc offices, etc.


Current development and standards

According to the ASTM E1384 Standard Guide for Content and Structure of the Electronic Health Record1 the EHR serves 
all of the functions of the traditional health record with many advantages. 
Usage of E1384 standards and E1633 coded values in the development of the EHR


APPROACH:
It will be a phased approach to this project. 

Phase 1

Find SME in :
1. medical records formats
2. EMR exchanges 
3. EHR information keepers /Vault (like Microsoft Health Vault)

Come up with a high level approach to the design which includes:
1. what kind of request/reply 
2. what needs to be transferred ( what kind of information, data)
3. the format of this information
4. separate emr on basic blocks of information with permissions and rights
5. determine how to divide the EMR by:
    a. relevance ( example: urologist does not need information about allergies, or perhaps very high level note)
    b. permission to access ( example: foot doc does not need to see scan of the head)
    c. which information is sharable with other participants vs. private doctors' notes
6. map the accessibility diagram, who , why and how gets access to certain blocks.
7. create a basic transportation format ( high level)
8. define certain fields that are needed to transfer pertinent information

Use of Funds:
SMEs salaries for 1/2 year - ???
My $
Possible travel, office space for meetings

Duration: 8 - 9 months after hiring of SMEs.


Phase 2

Find SME in cloud computing
Find partners among 'banks' to develop a beta version ( perhaps offer an piece of the action)
start designing Data definition layer
. Login sequence for participants
. Define the headers and trailers for any transmission
. Study the  possible usage of the following:

Today's standards:
----------------------------
---- Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard for handling, storing, printing, 
 and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and a network 
 communications protocol. The communication protocol is an application protocol that uses TCP/IP to
  communicate between systems. DICOM files can be exchanged between two entities that are capable of 
  receiving image and patient data in DICOM format. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 
  holds the copyright to this standard.[1] It was developed by the DICOM Standards Committee, whose members 
  are also partly members of NEMA.

               EXCHANGE FORMATS
----- The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to 
specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange. 
CDA is an ANSI-certified standard from Health Level Seven International (HL7.org). 

----- The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) specification is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify 
the encoding, structure, and semantics of a patient summary clinical document for exchange.


. Determine what kind of requests are possible from the participants and what information should be sent.
  this is THE MOST IMPORTANT piece. It will be evolving during the testing/poc process.
. Requests/Replies - pairs for information exchange
    . Get information request/Reply with information or Reject with an standard error like no priv or client not found, etc.
    . 

. Start drafting participants' agreement.
  It requires legal consulting
 

Phase 3
Beta roll-out with small number of participants ( several docs, patients, hosp, labs, banks)


Revenue projection.

Data from American Hospital Association
# of hospitals in US - 5627
# of admissions - 35M / per year of 2014
Data from CDC.gov
# of outpatient hospital visits - 125M
# of visits to physician 928M
data from American Clinical Lab Association
7B clinical lab tests per year
Data from KFF.org
4B  prescriptions in US per year


Each visit is associated with multiple updates to the patient's HR.

Assumptions:
1 doc visit - 2 updates , 4 requests - 12 transmissions
1 hosp admission - 20 updates, 40 requests  - 120 transmissions
1 lab - 1 update, 1 request - 4 transmissions
1 pharmacy - 1 update, 1 request

Assume .01% participation - translates to 40 - 50 M transmissions per year

Pricing should be scalable which depends on the # of trans, sort of transaction (request, reply, update, etc.) and agreement with
a participant.
Initially assume : average price per transmissions $1 ( minuscule compare to the price of the services)
$40 - $50 M/per year.

Potential
%50 participation - $20 - $25B /per year.

Final Cost:
Data Center initially will use cloud from Amazon or IBM - ?
10 - 15 technical people - $1.6 - $1.8M
5 managers - 1M
Sales force - ?
