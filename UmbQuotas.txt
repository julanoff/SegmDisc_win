To do:

1. Picture how this looks today
2. Picture for first rollout
3. Picture of the phase3  rollout
4. mention that MEDical News article

GOAL:

Create an infrastracture for ALL health care participants that enables secure, robust, reliable health info exchange.
It should be independant from the internal record format of the participants.
It should use common , standard communication protocols that will accomodate ALL necessary exchanges.
It should allow secure and reliable access to the clients' information which resides in the HRV.

Justification for the project:

Market Forces that will govern the evolution of the whole process.
The first step is to build rudimentary infrastructure.
Similarity with the banks money transfer networks (Bankwire, SWift, Telex, etc)
People have not been forced to keep their money in the banks. The convenience and different benefits are forcing people to the banks. After they deposit their money in the bank the people demand certain services with it.
In HR record keeping. 
There will be several HRV (Health Record Vaults) where people will keep their records.
What will force them to do it?
Ability to earn something by allowing anonimous access for researches, statistics, pharma sientists.
Convenience to access and manage own records real time.
Incentives to share the information to gain advance warning on certain abnormalities in the vitals

Future possible services and advances:
Virtual docs where several specialists will monitor your health virtually
This way if a person develops certain disease he or she can join the specialize network of physicians who will
monitor their conditions virtually, order tests, prescribe medicine, etc. If needed the person is directed to visit a doc.
That alone will drive health care cost tremendously.
+++

The competition between the HRVs will drive the innovation of the benefits, creating new apps, etc.
It will lead to demand to HRP (health care provider) to participate in this activities.
Before a person goes to a doc or lab he or she will demand participation in HRExchange.
There will be competition among HRVs and HRPs for a patient which will enhance this process.
It will evolve with time. New services, benefits, applications will be created.
IT people will compete in the new tremendous market of doctors, patients, hospitals, labs, etc.
It is similar to large companies like FundTEch, ACI who create MTS application for large players.
Variety of mobile apps creators to enable people's access to own information.



Participants:
HRVs ( similar to the banks)
Hospitals, large Labs ( similar to the corporate/financial institutions)
3rd party access providers - IT organizations that provide access to small Labs, doc offices, etc.






APPROACH:
It will be a phased approach to this project. 

Describe phase 1

Find SME in :
1. medical records formats
2. EMR exchanges 
3. EHR info keepers /Vault (like Microsoft Health Vault)

Come up with a high level approach to the design
That includes:
1. what kind of request/reply 
2. what needs to be transfered ( what kind of info, data)
3. the format of this info
4. seperate emr on basic blocks of info with permissions and rights
5. determine how to divide the EMR by 
`   a. relevance ( exa: urologist does not need info about alergies, or perhaps very high level note)
    b. permission to access ( exa: foot doc does not need to see scan of the head)
6. map the accessibility diagram, who , why and how gets access to certain blocks.
7. create a basic transportation format ( high level)
8. define certain fields that are needed to transfer pertinant info

Describe phase 2

Find SME in  cloud computing
Find partners among 'banks' to develop a beta version ( perhaps offer an piece of the action)
start designing Data definition layer


Describe Phase 3
Beta rollout with small number of participants ( several docs, patients, hosp, labs, banks)
