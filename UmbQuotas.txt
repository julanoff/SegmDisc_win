To do:

1. Picture how this looks today
2. Picture for first rollout
3. Picture of the phase3  rollout
4. mention that MEDical News article

Describe phase 1

Find SME in :
1. medical records formats
2. EMR exchanges 
3. EHR info keepers /Vault (like Microsoft Health Vault)

Come up with a high level approach to the design
That includes:
1. what kind of request/reply 
2. what needs to be transfered ( what kind of info, data)
3. the format of this info
4. seperate emr on basic blocks of info with permissions and rights
5. determine how to divide the EMR by 
`   a. relevance ( exa: urologist does not need info about alergies, or perhaps very high level note)
    b. permission to access ( exa: foot doc does not need to see scan of the head)
6. map the accessibility diagram, who , why and how gets access to certain blocks.
7. create a basic transportation format ( high level)
8. define certain fields that are needed to transfer pertinant info

Describe phase 2

Find SME in  cloud computing
Find partners among 'banks' to develop a beta version ( perhaps offer an piece of the action)
start designing Data definition layer


Describe Phase 3
Beta rollout with small number of participants ( several docs, patients, hosp, labs, banks)


Forces that will govern the whole process.
Similarity with the banks
People have not been and are not forces to keep their mony in the banks. The convenience and different perks are forcing people to the banks. After they deposit their money in the bank the people demand certain services with it.
In HR record keeping. 
There will be several HRV (Health Record Vaults) were people will keep their records.
What will force them to do it?
Ability to earn something by allowing anonimous access for researches, statistics, pharma sientists.
Convenience to access and manage own records real time.
+++

The competition between the HRVs will drive to innovating the perks, creating new apps, etc.
It will lead to demand to HRP (health care provider) to participate in this activities.
Before a person goes to a doc or lab he or she will demand participation in HRExchange.
There will be competition among HRVs and HRPs for a patient which will enhance this process.
It will evolve with time. New services, perks, applications will be created.
IT people will compete in the new tremendous market of doctors, patients, hospitals, labs, etc.
It is similar to large companies like FundTEch, ACI who create MTS application for large players.
Variety of mobile apps creators to enable people's access to own information.
