To do:

1. Picture how this looks today
2. Picture for first rollout
3. Picture of the phase3  rollout
4. mention that MEDical News article

Describe phase 1

Find SME in :
1. medical records formats
2. EMR exchanges 
3. EHR info keepers /Vault (like Microsoft Health Vault)

Come up with a high level approach to the design
That includes:
1. what kind of request/reply 
2. what needs to be transfered ( what kind of info, data)
3. the format of this info
4. seperate emr on basic blocks of info with permissions and rights
5. determine how to divide the EMR by 
`   a. relevance ( exa: urologist does not need info about alergies, or perhaps very high level note)
    b. permission to access ( exa: foot doc does not need to see scan of the head)
6. map the accessibility diagram, who , why and how gets access to certain blocks.
7. create a basic transportation format ( high level)
8. define certain fields that are needed to transfer pertinant info

Describe phase 2

Find SME in  cloud computing
Find partners among 'banks' to develop a beta version ( perhaps offer an piece of the action)
start designing Data definition layer


Describe Phase 3
Beta rollout with small number of participants ( several docs, patients, hosp, labs, banks)
