Benefits to the Bank

Comprehensive regression testing to find discrepancies due to the faulty software releases 
Completes payments by sening ALL ACKs/NAKs without having FED/CHIPS/SWIFT/RTPS real connectivity
Easily reintroduce payments via GPP real communication lines 
Increases efficiency by not wasting resources on processing unneeded messages and not spending time analyzing them
Produces the difference report quickly and efficiently which identified potential problems
Smart message selection based on the provided software changes and previous test results
Decreases the number of transactions for the test by at least 40%
Increases quality of testing with minimum efforts and resources
All of the above translates to SIGNIFICANT QA SAVINGS for the Bank.

simulation/regression
the main objective is to scrutinize the software realese by comparing the results against the 'production' values.
it must be done efficiently, robustly, and swiftly in order to execute the regression tests frequenly with minimum resources.
The Simulator will replay 'real' production traffic thru the new software release, 
provide all necessary ack/nak in order to complete all messages, 
compare the outbound payments, confirmations, adices, and feeds to the other partner
compare internal fields based on the config table and on the predefined rules of comparing.
It will substentially reduce 'noise' (fields that are always difffrent like: times, dates, etc).
We provide web based tools to analyse these results quickly and efficiently 

false hits reduction/scoring


the usage of the Simulator will 
diminish the embarrasing and costly production problems
enhance the comfort level of the funcionality before the release
speed up the QA
